# #Tuple is set same like list but here the difference is that the tuple is written either in round bracket or without square bracket.
# #But the input should always have comma after the datatype entered in an tuple variables.
# #Without comma the given input will not be considered as tuple.
# #we can give any datatyoe condition in tuple and also we can write multiple list of sets in tuple.
# ## Tuple is immutable which means the entered data cannot be changed or replaced.
# #####List is written in Square bracket not tuple.

# ##E.g.of tuple

# aTuple= (10)   ## even if this is in round bracket this will be considered as Int and not tuple because it is not having any comma.
# print(type(aTuple)) ##<class 'int'>

# aTuple= (10,) ##This is considered as Tuple because it has comma in it.
# print(type(aTuple)) ##<class 'tuple'>

# aTuple1=10,20,20,30,['white','red','blue'] ##This is also Tuple.
# print(type(aTuple1))  ###<class 'tuple'>



# #### =====================================================

# ##We can also create empty Tuple as given below....

# aTupleEmpty = ()         # TO CREATE EMPTY TUPLE
# print(aTupleEmpty)       # ()
# print(type(aTupleEmpty)) # <class 'tuple'>

# # aTupleEmpty2 = tuple()      # TO CREATE EMPTY TUPLE
# # print(aTupleEmpty2)       # ()
# # print(type(aTupleEmpty2)) # <class 'tuple'>

# #### =====================================================

# atuple_1 = 10,

# print(type(atuple_1)) ##<class 'tuple'>

# atup = (10,51,10.5,'red',['blue','white'])

# print(type(atup)) ##<class 'tuple'>
